### What I learned

how to creat tables (or some sort of ),separating two datas like ina column
<table>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
  </tr>

- also when you use <hr/> put it after the opening tag or element and before the value 
sample <p><hr/>hello world</p>

-10px is enough to make your corners a bit round
-adding color to the bullets and numbers 
li::marker {}

-making a word bold 
<b></b>
